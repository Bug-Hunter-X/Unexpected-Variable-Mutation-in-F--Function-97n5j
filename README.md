This repository demonstrates a common error in F# involving unexpected mutation of variables within a function. The function `add` intends to add two numbers, but due to the mutable nature of the input variables and in-place modification, the original variables are altered, resulting in incorrect output. The solution showcases a functional approach that avoids mutable variables and ensures that the original input parameters remain unchanged.
